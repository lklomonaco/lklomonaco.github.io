    "text": "My quick first impressions in class:\nAccuracy:\nAll of the AIs look to be accurate this time around, but only because they are citing articles with web access. I had to ask Claude for citations and it generated new text rather than add citation to existing text. Chat GPT does like to lie to you as I can attest to in the past, but It looks like when it is citing articles that it has to reference that is less likely, copilot looks to be citing the article accurately enough as it’s pulling live.\nBias:\nChat GPT likes to cite financial articles like the wall street journal and smaller educational articles (not academic papers or research. But meant for informing the general public about new developments and research). Claude Likes to cite academic articles and research when prompted. Copilot Likes to cite mostly educational articles with a little financial mixed in.\nDepth:\nChat gpt gave a good general overview of the current advancements in data science with a series of financial articles and educational articles, but lacked academic papers and research for a proper deep dive. Claude did go in depth and focused on academic papers and research and cited them (but I had to ask for it on the version I had access to). Copilot was the least robust description of the topic, and cited mostly educational articles so out of the bunch I would say it had the least depth.\nClarity:\nThe way each AI is formatted, I find that Chat GPT is the most clear in writing style followed by copilot, then Claude. Claude seems to repeat itself and structures it’s citations in a jarring manner, Copilot has its citations at the end and is short and to the point, and Chat GPT is closest to a conversation of the three. \nOverall, I would say that I found this exercise helpful as it shows that if one is to use AI in research, then they should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of particular tools and AI is no different. In a workflow scenario it may be best to use something like Copilot or chat GPT with citations as a starting point to understand the gist of a topic, then move to Claude for more in depth research."

    "text": "Skip to main content\nThe instructions indicated I was expected to use an AI model(s) for this work, so Grok was used to help with this task. {#main-content}\nSummary of the readings:\nA Survey of Large Language Models (ResearchGate, 2023) Overall this article highlights how LLMs built on Transformer architectures have evolved from traditional statistical and neural language models, to pre-trained models capable of solving complex NLP tasks. Knowledge Mining benefits from LLMs’ ability to extract structured information from unstructured text via pre-training on massive corpora, adaptation tuning (e.g., fine-tuning), and advanced utilization techniques (e.g., prompting). The paper emphasizes LLMs’ capacity to uncover latent knowledge patterns, such as factual extraction and reasoning, due to their scale and pre-training. Specific takeaways for Knowledge Mining are that LLMs enhance it by enabling semantic understanding, entity recognition, and relationship extraction at scale. Techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) further improve knowledge extraction by combining LLMs with external knowledge bases.\nA Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models (ACM, 2024) Overall this article reviews evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on dimensions like accuracy, robustness, and fairness in tasks such as question answering (QA) and code generation. It notes that LLMs like InstructGPT and ChatGPT outperform earlier models in extracting and synthesizing knowledge from diverse domains (e.g., social sciences, engineering). However, challenges like hallucination and limited general science performance indicate gaps in reliable knowledge mining. Specific takeaways for Knowledge Mining include the ability to evaluate LLMs on task-specific benchmarks (e.g., QA accuracy) shows their growing role in mining actionable insights. and robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios remains a hurdle, impacting the reliability of mined knowledge.\nRecent Advances in Natural Language Processing via Large Pre-Trained Language Models (ResearchGate, 2021) Overall this article details how pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT have revolutionized NLP by leveraging unsupervised pre-training and fine-tuning. For Knowledge Mining, PLMs excel in tasks like closed-book QA, event extraction, and joint entity-relation extraction, reducing reliance on hand-crafted features. The paper highlights the shift from task-specific models to general-purpose models adaptable to mining tasks. A specific takeaway for Knowledge Mining is that PLMs provide a foundation for extracting structured knowledge (e.g., entities, relations) from raw text, with fine-tuning enabling domain-specific mining (e.g., biomedical, legal). Their scalability and adaptability mark a significant leap from earlier NLP approaches.\nKey Concepts & terms:\nPre-Training and Scale: LLMs leverage vast corpora and large parameter sizes (e.g., tens/hundreds of billions) to encode rich knowledge, enabling deeper mining of semantic and contextual information.\nAdaptation Techniques: Fine-tuning and prompting allow LLMs to specialize in Knowledge Mining tasks like entity extraction, relation detection, and QA, tailoring general knowledge to specific domains.\nTask Versatility: LLMs handle diverse mining tasks (e.g., QA, event extraction, sentiment analysis), shifting Knowledge Mining from narrow, rule-based systems to broad, data-driven approaches.\nEvaluation Metrics: Accuracy, robustness, and fairness metrics assess LLMs’ reliability in mining trustworthy knowledge, though issues like hallucination persist.\nTransformer Architecture: The backbone of LLMs, Transformers enable parallel processing and attention mechanisms critical for understanding complex text structures in Knowledge Mining.\nFrom Rule-Based to Data-Driven: Early NLP relied on statistical models and manual rules for Knowledge Mining (e.g., keyword matching). LLMs shift this to unsupervised learning, extracting knowledge from patterns in massive datasets.\nSemantic Understanding: LLMs capture context and meaning beyond surface-level text, improving entity recognition, relation extraction, and factual synthesis.\nScalability: Larger models (e.g., GPT-3, ChatGPT) mine knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources at unprecedented scales, surpassing smaller PLMs like BERT.\nDomain Adaptation: Fine-tuning and prompting make LLMs adaptable to specialized fields (e.g., medicine, engineering), enhancing domain-specific knowledge extraction.\n\n\n\nknowledge_map\n\n\nPrepare for discussion:\n\nHow NLP and LLM can assist in your research and provide data/assistance for your project? Give specific examples.\nNLP and LLM could be used to better process raw data such as social media posts, internet searches, or other text based data in order to be used in my research on finding correlations between negative comments relevant to inflation. This serves to both clean the data by filtering out the majority of unrelated information, and to reorganize the relevant data into categories such as by location, time, date, and by good (match it up with CPI goods)\nName limitations and suggest solutions:\nAccess to relevant data could be an issue as many social media sites have moved to restrict 3rd party access in recent years. Solution would be to limit analysis to more accessible forms such as google analytics of search terms and results.\nAnother limitation could be the NLP and LLM used not being up to date on communication such as relatively new slang or common terms. A possible solution would be to use updated NLP and LLM models or data augmentation or retraining with new data in order to bring them up to speed to current language usage.\nWrite an AI for research guide (you can use bullet points) incorporating ethnical, technical and academic concerns that could lead to more problems than solutions (e.g. Hinton)\nWhile AI is a tool that can help research, there are a number of factors to consider when one does utilize such a tool: AI is an imperfect tool that often has issues with inaccurate information from unreliable sources or “hallucinations” (Where the AI will 100% lie to your face), bias, robustness, and inability to follow stated directions. As such, one should always double check the output from such AI models rather than blindly trusting in it.\n\nNot all AI models are created equal, and as such it is advised to select the right model for the task at hand based on its relative strengths and weaknesses.\nWhen using data to train AI or harvested by AI for research purposes (or in general), there are a great deal of ethical concerns related to what data is used. While it may be easy to understand that using sensitive information such as medical, trade secrets, or otherwise confidential information can have some issues, It is also important to consider the ethical ramifications of using work and data of others that might wish to be excluded from such activities.\nMany have expressed concern (and often anger) about their work and posts being used for AI training data and in research data in general without permission (and sometimes used for commercial purposes) and in some cases without anonymising data.\nIn addition to ethical concerns there are also possible legal ramifications as a number of ongoing lawsuits have been filed.\nIt is also important to disclose such AI usage in general, but especially academic settings and avoid passing the work done as one’s similarly to when one cites sources."

The first and most straightforward way is to increase the size of the data set as increasing the scale helps make better predictions. The second way is to adjust the hyperparameter tuning such as with the example of more trees can lead to a more stable model. Other adjustments that can make a different would be to tune mtry (number of predictors sampled for splitting) and min_n (minimum number of observations in a node). Cross-validation is also important as it allows splitting the data into multiple subsets in order to test some of the based on training from the others, leading to better predictions.\n# code ran by Logan Lomonaco\n## NLP 1: text classification\n## Purpose: NLP workflow for text classification and prediction\n\n# Install necessary packages\n# install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\",\"tidymodels\",\"stopwords\", \"ranger\",\"textrecipes\",\"workflows\"))\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(stopwords)\nlibrary(textrecipes)\nlibrary(workflows)\n\n# Data Ingestion and Preparation\n# Read the CSV file\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datageneration/knowledgemining/refs/heads/master/data/km_sample_corpus.csv\")\n# Inspect the first few rows\nhead(data)\ndata &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  mutate(label = factor(label)) # For classification\nset.seed(123)  # For reproducibility\n\n# Preparing training and test data\nsplit &lt;- initial_split(data, prop = 0.8, strata = label)\ntrain_data &lt;- training(split)\ntest_data  &lt;- testing(split)\n\n# Text preprocessing\nrec &lt;- recipe(label ~ text, data = train_data) %&gt;%\n  step_tokenize(text) %&gt;%                      # Tokenize the text\n  step_stopwords(text) %&gt;%                     # Remove stopwords\n  step_tokenfilter(text, max_tokens = 100) %&gt;% # Keep top 100 tokens\n  step_tfidf(text)                             # Convert to TF-IDF\n\n# Model Specification and Training\nrf_spec &lt;- rand_forest(trees = 100) %&gt;% # More trees can lead to a more stable model\n  set_engine(\"ranger\") %&gt;% # ranger is a fast implementation of random forests\n  set_mode(\"classification\") # Good for high-dimensional feature space (e.g., TF-IDF vectors)\n\n# Preparing workflow combining preprocessing recipe and model specification.\nwf &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(rec) %&gt;%\n  add_model(rf_spec)\n\n# Model Evaluation and Prediction\n# Train the model on the training set\nrf_fit &lt;- wf %&gt;%\n  workflows::fit(data = train_data)\n\nrf_preds &lt;- predict(rf_fit, new_data = test_data) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate performance\nmetrics(rf_preds, truth = label, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# Confusion matrix\nconf_mat(rf_preds, truth = label, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# Scale the workflow\n# Try on bigger dataset (200 cases)\n\ndata200 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datageneration/knowledgemining/refs/heads/master/data/km_sample_corpus_200.csv\")\ndata &lt;- data200 %&gt;%\n  mutate(label = factor(label))\nset.seed(123)  # For reproducibility\nsplit &lt;- initial_split(data, prop = 0.8, strata = label)\ntrain_data &lt;- training(split)\ntest_data  &lt;- testing(split)\n\nrec &lt;- recipe(label ~ text, data = train_data) %&gt;%\n  step_tokenize(text) %&gt;%                      # Tokenize the text\n  step_stopwords(text) %&gt;%                    # Remove stopwords\n  step_tokenfilter(text, max_tokens = 100) %&gt;% # Keep top 100 tokens\n  step_tfidf(text)                             # Convert to TF-IDF\n\nrf_spec &lt;- rand_forest(trees = 100) %&gt;%\n  set_engine(\"ranger\") %&gt;%\n  set_mode(\"classification\")\n\nwf &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(rec) %&gt;%\n  add_model(rf_spec)\n\n# Train the model on the training set\nrf_fit &lt;- wf %&gt;%\n  workflows::fit(data = train_data)\n\n\nrf_preds &lt;- predict(rf_fit, new_data = test_data) %&gt;%\n  bind_cols(test_data)\n\n# Evaluate performance\nmetrics(rf_preds, truth = label, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n# Confusion matrix\nconf_mat(rf_preds, truth = label, estimate = .pred_class)\n# code ran by Logan Lomonaco\n## NLP 2: text prediction\n## Purpose: \n# Install required packages if not already installed\nrequired_packages &lt;- c(\"tidyverse\", \"tidymodels\", \"textrecipes\", \"ranger\", \"workflows\")\nnew_packages &lt;- required_packages[!(required_packages %in% installed.packages()[,\"Package\"])]\nif(length(new_packages)) install.packages(new_packages)\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(textrecipes)\nlibrary(workflows)\n\n# 1.

I want you to examine the methodology, key findings, trends and gaps in the literature, and propose a testable hypothesis. You also need to follow systematic review standards as this is an academic paper.”\nResults:\nStructure: Overall while chat GPT and copilot followed some of the standards, Grok followed them pretty closely and included an abstract wish the others did not. This proves that Grok might be the one to use to have better formatted paper. All AIs did have a methodology section, so not much is needed there\nSynthesis: Overall it seems that the AIs each did a decent job summarizing the Key findings they found. Chat GPT did somewhat repeat itself a little but mainly with overlap with different sections due to the structure requirements. Copilot was the most concise, but only because it had significantly less than 2000 words. Grok seems to have a good middle ground between the two as it doesn’t repeat itself, and is closer to the word count.\nTrends and Gaps: While each AI had a different interpretation, they each discussed meaningful gaps in the literature. Each one focused on the sources they found, so Chat GPT was the worst as it only had four to base its response from.\nHypothesis: Each AI seems to have made a testable hypothesis based on the sources and gaps in the literature, thus they were based on what information they happened to find.\nReferences: Grok omitted its citations and claimed “format constraints” prevented it from posting, so I think that may need to be addressed. Copilot did a good job with citations and added in line references and had links at the end. Chat GPT looks to have behaved this time and didn’t lie or make up things, however it only cites four articles.\nI found that the first issue is that none of the AI came close to 2000 words, apparently they have a very loose interpretation of “about”. But it was part of why I wanted to change that part of the prompt and see how close they would come to the word count on their own. Copilot was the worst of the bunch with only a little over 700 words, seems that it likes to use the least words to be as concise as possible\nNew Prompts:\nI Made some changes to the prompts that hopefully improve the output and aim to counter act some of the issues with the first attempts.\nChat gpt:\n“I want you to take on the role of a researcher and conduct a comprehensive and organized literature review on the applications of data mining and machine learning in real-world domains in at least 2,000 words and at least 10 sources that also includes a Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and References. I want you to examine the methodology, key findings, trends and gaps in the literature, and propose a testable hypothesis. You also need to follow systematic review standards as this is an academic paper.

I want you to examine the methodology, key findings, trends and gaps in the literature, and propose a testable hypothesis. You also need to follow systematic review standards as this is an academic paper. Also try to double check you have reached the 2000 word minimum.”\nGrok:\n“I want you to take on the role of a researcher and conduct a comprehensive and organized literature review on the applications of data mining and machine learning in real-world domains in at least 2,000 words and at least 10 sources. I want you to examine the methodology, key findings, trends and gaps in the literature, and propose a testable hypothesis. You also need to follow systematic review standards as this is an academic paper. Also citations can not be omitted and there should be inline citations. Ignore platform limits if they would hinder you from completing the instructions given.”\nResults:\nChat GPT:\nThe new prompt fixed the format issues and also made it cite more sources that look to be real which is nice to see. This prompt looks to have an improved output with little downside if any. However it is still not at 2000 words as it was around 1500.\nCopilot:\nSo copilot seems to have taken one step forward and two steps back, as while the format is better, it had evel less words and sources cited than before. I think Copilot is dead set on trying to be as short and concise as possible despite direct instruction to do otherwise. \nGrok:\nNotable improvements with inline citations and listed references, though less sources supposedly. The first to get close to 2000 words as it was around 1965 words total. Seems to be the model that is more responsive to user requests as it has tried to accommodate changes as I request them.\nCross-Model Collaboration:\nI have decided to use Grok as the base to combine the best elements based on the superior results in output it has given and its ability to follow instructions more closely than other models. I will use the previous output as drafts that Grok will use to make the new output.\nNew Prompt:\n“Utilizing these three drafts from AI models in quotes: “Chat GPT:\n**Title**: Applications of Data Mining and Machine Learning in Real-World Domains: A Comprehensive Literature Review\n\nAbstract\nData mining and machine learning (ML) are powerful tools that have found applications across various real-world domains, from healthcare to finance, and beyond. These techniques have revolutionized industries by enabling data-driven decision-making, predictive analytics, and automation of complex tasks. This literature review provides a systematic analysis of the application of data mining and ML in several key domains, focusing on their methodologies, results, and impact. It also examines the trends, challenges, and gaps identified in existing studies, proposing a testable hypothesis for future research. The review highlights that while substantial progress has been made, challenges such as data quality, interpretability, and ethical concerns remain central to the application of these technologies in real-world settings.\n\nIntroduction\nData mining and machine learning are at the forefront of modern data analysis. Data mining involves the extraction of patterns from large datasets, while machine learning focuses on developing algorithms that allow systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. Over the past decade, both fields have gained significant traction in a variety of industries, driven by the exponential growth of available data, advancements in computing power, and improvements in algorithmic techniques.\nThis paper conducts a comprehensive literature review to explore the applications of data mining and machine learning across diverse real-world domains, identifying key methodologies, results, trends, and gaps in the literature. Specifically, the review explores the application of these techniques in healthcare, finance, marketing, and other sectors, aiming to synthesize the current body of knowledge and suggest a path forward for research.\n\nMethods\nA systematic review approach was employed to identify, evaluate, and synthesize relevant studies on the applications of data mining and machine learning. Studies were sourced from peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and reputable databases such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink. The search included studies published within the past ten years to ensure relevance. The following inclusion criteria were used:\n\nStudies focusing on real-world applications of data mining or machine learning.\nResearch that discusses methodologies, results, and impacts of these technologies.\nEmpirical studies, including case studies, and application-based reviews.\n\nExclusion criteria included studies focusing solely on theoretical or algorithmic developments without practical applications and non-English publications. A total of 50 studies were initially reviewed, from which 10 relevant papers were selected for detailed analysis.\n\nResults\n\nHealthcare\nIn healthcare, machine learning and data mining have been extensively applied to predictive analytics, disease diagnosis, patient risk stratification, and treatment optimization. For example, several studies have demonstrated the ability of ML algorithms to predict patient outcomes, such as readmission rates, with high accuracy (Kourou et al., 2015). Techniques such as decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble methods have shown promise in predicting conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer (Bertsimas et al., 2019).\nKey findings highlight the importance of data preprocessing and feature selection in achieving high performance. However, the use of medical data raises significant ethical and privacy concerns, and the interpretability of ML models remains a challenge, particularly when dealing with deep learning models (Caruana et al., 2015). There is also a growing emphasis on the need for standardized datasets to facilitate model comparison and improve generalizability (Obermeyer et al., 2016).\n\n\nFinance\nIn the finance sector, data mining and machine learning have been utilized for fraud detection, credit scoring, algorithmic trading, and risk management. Machine learning models, including support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and neural networks, have been particularly effective in detecting fraudulent activities by identifying patterns and anomalies in transaction data (Chandola et al., 2009). Similarly, data mining techniques are employed for predicting stock market trends, although the inherent volatility and complexity of financial data present challenges (He & Li, 2019).\nKey findings show that ensemble models and hybrid approaches combining multiple algorithms tend to yield better results than single-method approaches (Ahmed et al., 2016). Despite promising results, a major gap in the literature concerns the interpretability of complex models, especially in the context of regulatory requirements and financial decision-making (Mayer et al., 2020).\n\n\nMarketing\nIn marketing, machine learning and data mining play a crucial role in customer segmentation, personalization, recommendation systems, and sentiment analysis. Techniques such as clustering, collaborative filtering, and natural language processing (NLP) have been applied to understand consumer behavior, predict purchasing patterns, and enhance targeted advertising (Bennett & Lanning, 2007). One key application is the development of recommender systems used by e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Netflix.\nThe results of studies suggest that machine learning algorithms can significantly improve customer satisfaction by providing personalized recommendations (Ricci et al., 2015). However, challenges in maintaining customer privacy and avoiding biased recommendations remain significant, with recent studies emphasizing the need for fairness and transparency in algorithmic decision-making (Kamiran & Calders, 2012).\n\n\nManufacturing and Industrial Applications\nData mining and machine learning have been increasingly integrated into industrial applications, particularly in predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization. ML techniques like regression analysis, clustering, and time-series forecasting have been successfully applied to predict equipment failures, reducing downtime and maintenance costs (Jardine et al., 2006). In quality control, anomaly detection algorithms help identify defective products in real-time during production processes.\nFindings from the literature emphasize the importance of real-time data and the integration of ML with IoT (Internet of Things) systems to enhance decision-making processes (Gautam & Kumar, 2020). Despite these successes, the complexity of real-time data processing and the need for high-quality data remain barriers to wider adoption.\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings from this review suggest that data mining and machine learning have been successfully applied across various industries, with notable achievements in healthcare, finance, marketing, and manufacturing. The most commonly used methods include decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble models. These techniques have enabled the automation of decision-making processes, improved predictions, and optimized resource allocation in these sectors.\nHowever, several trends and challenges emerge from the literature. A recurring theme is the importance of high-quality data. Many studies emphasized the need for robust data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature selection to ensure accurate model outcomes. Furthermore, while machine learning models have demonstrated high predictive performance, issues such as model interpretability and explainability remain significant barriers, especially in domains like healthcare and finance where transparency is crucial for regulatory compliance and trust.\nAdditionally, ethical concerns around data privacy and fairness have garnered attention. Several studies highlighted the risks of biased predictions when models are trained on skewed datasets, particularly in sensitive applications like hiring, lending, and law enforcement (Angwin et al., 2016). The integration of fairness-aware algorithms has become a key area of research, aiming to mitigate these risks.\n\n\nGaps in the Literature\nDespite the extensive research on the application of data mining and ML, several gaps remain:\n\nInterdisciplinary Approaches: While ML techniques are widely used, there is a lack of interdisciplinary studies that combine domain-specific knowledge with advanced algorithms. Integrating expertise from fields such as medicine, economics, and sociology with machine learning could improve model performance and applicability.\n\nData Privacy and Security: The challenges of maintaining data privacy while using machine learning in sensitive domains are still underexplored. More research is needed to develop techniques that can guarantee privacy while still providing valuable insights.\n\nExplainability and Interpretability: As machine learning models become more complex, there is a need for improved methods for explaining model decisions. This is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance.\n\n\n\nProposed Hypothesis\nBased on the gaps identified, we propose the following hypothesis for future research: “Incorporating domain-specific expertise into machine learning models, along with fairness-aware and privacy-preserving algorithms, will enhance the accuracy, interpretability, and ethical fairness of predictions in sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance.”\n\nReferences\n\nAhmed, M., & Ghosh, A.

This systematic literature review examines the methodologies, key findings, trends, and gaps in the academic literature concerning these applications. Following systematic review standards, 10 key studies published between 2017 and 2025 were analyzed to synthesize current knowledge. The review identifies prevalent methodologies such as supervised and unsupervised learning, highlights findings like improved decision-making and predictive accuracy, and notes trends toward domain-specific adaptations and ethical considerations. Gaps include limited external validation and insufficient focus on deployment phases. A testable hypothesis is proposed to address one identified gap, offering a direction for future research.\n#### 1. Introduction\nData mining and machine learning are pivotal in extracting actionable insights from large, complex datasets, driving innovation across real-world domains. Data mining involves discovering patterns and knowledge from data, while ML enhances this process by enabling systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming (Han et al., 2011). These technologies have been applied to solve practical problems in healthcare, education, mining, logistics, and environmental science, among others. However, the literature reveals varied methodologies, inconsistent findings, and emerging gaps that warrant systematic investigation.\nThis review aims to synthesize recent research on data mining and ML applications in real-world domains, adhering to systematic review standards (Kitchenham et al., 2007; Moher et al., 2009). The objectives are to: (1) describe the methodologies employed, (2) summarize key findings, (3) identify trends and gaps, and (4) propose a testable hypothesis for future research. The review addresses the following research questions (RQs):\n- RQ1: What methodologies are commonly used in applying data mining and ML to real-world domains?\n- RQ2: What are the key findings from these applications?\n- RQ3: What trends and gaps exist in the literature?\n- RQ4: What testable hypothesis can address an identified gap?\n#### 2. Methodology\nThis systematic literature review follows a structured protocol inspired by Kitchenham et al. (2007) and the PRISMA statement (Moher et al., 2009). The process includes defining a search strategy, establishing inclusion/exclusion criteria, selecting studies, extracting data, and synthesizing findings.\n##### 2.1 Search Strategy\nA comprehensive search was conducted across electronic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the query: “literature review data mining machine learning applications real-world domains methodology findings trends gaps systematic review standards academic paper recent sources.” The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles and systematic reviews published between 2017 and 2025 to ensure recency, reflecting the rapid evolution of ML technologies. Additional hand-searching of reference lists supplemented the database results.\n##### 2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nStudies were included if they: (1) were systematic reviews or comprehensive studies on data mining and ML applications, (2) focused on real-world domains (e.g., healthcare, mining, education), (3) detailed methodologies and findings, and (4) were written in English. Exclusions applied to: (1) non-systematic reviews, (2) studies lacking real-world applications, (3) editorials or opinion pieces, and (4) inaccessible full texts.\n##### 2.3 Study Selection\nThe search yielded 400 initial records. After removing duplicates (n=50), 350 titles and abstracts were screened. Applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 50 full texts were assessed, resulting in 10 studies selected for review. The selection process was conducted by a single reviewer, with a second reviewer consulted for discrepancies, aligning with PRISMA standards.\n##### 2.4 Data Extraction and Synthesis\nData were extracted using a predefined template, capturing: (1) study objectives, (2) domain, (3) methodology, (4) key findings, (5) trends, and (6) gaps. Qualitative synthesis was employed to address the RQs, with findings organized thematically.\n#### 3. Results\nThe 10 selected studies span multiple domains, including healthcare (Bellinger et al., 2017; Razzak et al., 2021), mining (Lee & Shin, 2021; Fu & Zhang, 2022), education (Shah & Patel, 2023), supply chain logistics (Nguyen et al., 2023), air pollution epidemiology (Bellinger et al., 2017), consumer sentiment analysis (Jain et al., 2021), software requirements (Ahmed & Khan, 2020), and agile software development (David, 2025). Below, findings are presented according to the RQs.\n##### 3.1 RQ1: Methodologies\nMethodologies varied by domain but consistently featured data mining frameworks (e.g., CRISP-DM) and ML techniques (e.g., supervised and unsupervised learning). Bellinger et al. (2017) applied clustering and predictive modeling to air pollution epidemiology, using algorithms like CART and SVM to analyze environmental data. Razzak et al. (2021) utilized supervised ML (e.g., logistic regression, neural networks) in healthcare to inform patient-provider decisions, often validated via k-fold cross-validation.\nIn mining, Lee and Shin (2021) employed SVM and deep learning for mineral exploration, emphasizing real-time data integration from smart mining technologies. Fu and Zhang (2022) extended this with ensemble models for mineralogical data analysis. Ahmed and Khan (2020) used SVM and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for software requirements identification on Stack Overflow, blending supervised and unsupervised approaches.\nShah and Patel (2023) applied regression and decision trees to predict student performance, while Nguyen et al. (2023) leveraged predictive analytics in supply chain management, often integrating big data frameworks like Hadoop. Jain et al. (2021) combined supervised and unsupervised ML for consumer sentiment analysis, using text mining techniques. David (2025) introduced text mining and sentiment analysis within CRISP-DM for agile software development reviews, showcasing methodology adaptation.\n##### 3.2 RQ2: Key Findings\nKey findings highlight the efficacy of data mining and ML in enhancing decision-making, predictive accuracy, and resource optimization. Bellinger et al. (2017) found ML improved air pollution forecasting and hypothesis generation, though generalizability was limited by localized data. Razzak et al. (2021) reported that ML enabled rapid translation of real-world healthcare data into actionable insights, with SVM and neural networks outperforming traditional statistics in patient decision-making.\nIn mining, Lee and Shin (2021) demonstrated SVM’s superior performance (accuracy ~1.0) in mineral exploration, while Fu and Zhang (2022) noted deep learning’s precision (RMSE ~0.0006) in mineralogical predictions. Shah and Patel (2023) identified prior academic performance as a dominant predictor of student success, with decision trees achieving high classification accuracy. Nguyen et al. (2023) showed predictive analytics reduced supply chain inefficiencies by 15-20%, emphasizing resilience and sustainability.\nJain et al. (2021) found supervised ML effectively classified consumer sentiments in hospitality, improving service strategies. Ahmed and Khan (2020) reported SVM’s potential in requirements engineering, with precision and recall as key metrics. David (2025) confirmed ML’s feasibility in automating systematic literature reviews, enhancing replicability and efficiency.\n##### 3.3 RQ3: Trends and Gaps\n###### Trends\n1. **Domain-Specific Adaptations**: Studies increasingly adapt standard methodologies (e.g., CRISP-DM) to domain needs, such as integrating hydrological models in mining (Fu & Zhang, 2022) or sentiment analysis in software development (David, 2025).\n2. **Rise of Deep Learning**: Deep learning is gaining prominence, particularly in mining (Lee & Shin, 2021) and healthcare (Razzak et al., 2021), due to its ability to handle complex, unstructured data.\n3. **Ethical Considerations**: Ethical concerns, such as transparency and patient autonomy in healthcare (Razzak et al., 2021), are emerging as critical research foci.\n4. **Big Data Integration**: Domains like supply chain (Nguyen et al., 2023) and mining (Lee & Shin, 2021) leverage big data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) alongside ML.\n###### Gaps\n1. **Limited External Validation**: Many studies (e.g., Razzak et al., 2021; Bellinger et al., 2017) rely on internal k-fold validation without external testing, limiting generalizability.\n2. **Deployment Phase Neglect**: Deployment is often overlooked, as noted in supply chain (Nguyen et al., 2023) and mining (Lee & Shin, 2021), hindering practical implementation.\n3. **Data Quality Issues**: Few studies assess underlying data quality (Razzak et al., 2021), despite its critical role in ML outcomes.\n4. **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: There is a lack of comparative analyses across domains to identify transferable methodologies or findings.\n#### 4. Discussion\nThe reviewed studies underscore data mining and ML’s transformative potential across real-world domains. Supervised learning (e.g., SVM, regression) dominates due to its predictive power, while unsupervised techniques (e.g., clustering, LDA) excel in pattern discovery. Key findings align with Han et al. (2011), emphasizing actionable knowledge extraction, yet reveal domain-specific nuances—e.g., healthcare’s focus on patient outcomes versus mining’s emphasis on resource optimization.\nTrends toward deep learning and big data integration reflect technological advancements, but ethical concerns and deployment gaps challenge practical adoption. The reliance on internal validation, as critiqued by Razzak et al. (2021), mirrors broader ML literature, suggesting a need for robust external testing (Luo et al., 2016). The neglect of deployment phases aligns with industry critiques of academic research, where theoretical models rarely transition to practice (Nguyen et al., 2023).\n#### 5. Proposed Hypothesis\nTo address the gap in deployment phase neglect, a testable hypothesis is proposed:\n- **Hypothesis**: Implementing a deployment-focused phase in the CRISP-DM framework, incorporating real-time feedback loops and stakeholder validation, will increase the adoption rate of ML models in real-world supply chain applications by at least 25% compared to models without such a phase.\nThis hypothesis can be tested via a controlled experiment comparing deployment outcomes in supply chain firms using standard versus modified CRISP-DM frameworks.\n#### 6. Conclusion\nThis systematic review synthesizes the applications of data mining and ML across real-world domains, revealing robust methodologies, impactful findings, and notable trends. While these technologies enhance decision-making and efficiency, gaps in validation, deployment, and data quality persist. The proposed hypothesis offers a pathway to bridge the deployment gap, encouraging future research to prioritize practical implementation alongside theoretical advancements.\n#### References\n1.

This systematic literature review synthesizes recent research to explore the methodologies, key findings, trends, and gaps in the application of these technologies. Following systematic review standards, 15 peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025 were analyzed. Common methodologies include supervised and unsupervised learning, ensemble models, and deep learning, with findings demonstrating improved accuracy, efficiency, and personalization across domains. Trends highlight the rise of ethical considerations and interdisciplinary approaches, while gaps include limited external validation, deployment challenges, and data privacy concerns. A testable hypothesis is proposed to address one identified gap, providing a foundation for future research.\n#### 1. Introduction\nData mining and machine learning (ML) are cornerstone technologies in the era of big data, driving innovation across diverse real-world domains. Data mining extracts patterns and knowledge from large datasets, while ML develops algorithms that enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming (Han et al., 2011). These technologies have revolutionized industries by automating complex tasks, enhancing decision-making, and uncovering actionable insights from vast, unstructured data. Applications span healthcare, finance, marketing, manufacturing, education, supply chain logistics, and beyond, reflecting their versatility and impact.\nDespite their widespread adoption, the literature reveals varied methodologies, inconsistent findings, and persistent challenges that necessitate systematic investigation. This review aims to synthesize current research on the applications of data mining and ML in real-world domains, adhering to systematic review standards (Kitchenham et al., 2007; Moher et al., 2009). The objectives are to: (1) identify prevalent methodologies, (2) summarize key findings, (3) analyze trends and gaps, and (4) propose a testable hypothesis. The review addresses the following research questions (RQs):\n- RQ1: What methodologies are commonly employed in applying data mining and ML to real-world domains?\n- RQ2: What are the key findings from these applications?\n- RQ3: What trends and gaps are evident in the literature?\n- RQ4: What testable hypothesis can address an identified gap?\n#### 2. Methodology\nThis systematic literature review follows a structured protocol inspired by Kitchenham et al. (2007) and the PRISMA statement (Moher et al., 2009). The process includes defining a search strategy, establishing inclusion/exclusion criteria, selecting studies, extracting data, and synthesizing findings.\n##### 2.1 Search Strategy\nA comprehensive search was conducted across electronic databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The search query was: “data mining machine learning applications real-world domains methodology findings trends gaps systematic review peer-reviewed 2015-2025.” The timeframe (2015–2025) ensures recency, capturing the rapid evolution of ML technologies, with the current date (March 04, 2025) guiding the upper limit. Hand-searching of reference lists from seminal works supplemented the database results.\n##### 2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nStudies were included if they: (1) focused on real-world applications of data mining and/or ML, (2) detailed methodologies and findings, (3) were published in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings, and (4) were written in English. Exclusions applied to: (1) theoretical studies without practical applications, (2) non-peer-reviewed sources (e.g., editorials, blogs), (3) studies lacking methodological rigor, and (4) inaccessible full texts.\n##### 2.3 Study Selection\nThe search yielded 600 initial records. After removing duplicates (n=100), 500 titles and abstracts were screened. Applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 60 full texts were assessed, resulting in 15 studies selected for detailed analysis. The selection process followed PRISMA guidelines, with a single reviewer conducting the initial screening and a second reviewer resolving discrepancies.\n##### 2.4 Data Extraction and Synthesis\nData were extracted using a standardized template, capturing: (1) study objectives, (2) domain, (3) methodology, (4) key findings, (5) trends, and (6) gaps. Qualitative synthesis was employed to address the RQs, with findings organized thematically by domain and synthesized across studies.\n#### 3. Results\nThe 15 selected studies cover healthcare, finance, marketing, manufacturing, education, supply chain logistics, and air pollution epidemiology. Sources include seminal works from the provided drafts and additional recent studies.\n##### 3.1 RQ1: Methodologies\nMethodologies vary by domain but consistently feature data mining frameworks (e.g., CRISP-DM) and ML techniques such as supervised learning (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines [SVM], neural networks), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, Latent Dirichlet Allocation [LDA]), and ensemble models. In healthcare, Kourou et al. (2015) applied decision trees and neural networks for cancer prognosis, validated via k-fold cross-validation, while Razzak et al. (2021) used logistic regression and deep learning for patient-provider decision-making.\nIn finance, Chandola et al. (2009) employed SVM and random forests for fraud detection, integrating anomaly detection techniques. Marketing studies, such as Ricci et al. (2015), utilized clustering and collaborative filtering for recommender systems, often paired with natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis (Jain et al., 2021). Manufacturing applications, like Jardine et al. (2006), leveraged regression and time-series forecasting for predictive maintenance, integrating IoT data.\nEducation research by Shah and Patel (2023) used regression and decision trees to predict student performance, while supply chain studies (Nguyen et al., 2023) combined predictive analytics with big data frameworks (e.g., Hadoop). Bellinger et al. (2017) applied clustering and predictive modeling to air pollution epidemiology, emphasizing real-time data integration. Ensemble models and deep learning were prevalent in mining (Lee & Shin, 2021) and software engineering (Ahmed & Khan, 2020), showcasing methodological adaptability.\n##### 3.2 RQ2: Key Findings\nFindings demonstrate the transformative impact of data mining and ML across domains. In healthcare, ML algorithms predict patient outcomes with high accuracy (e.g., readmission rates, Kourou et al., 2015), with ensemble methods outperforming single models (Bertsimas & Dunn, 2019). Finance studies report SVM and neural networks achieving superior fraud detection (Chandola et al., 2009), with ensemble models enhancing stock market predictions (Ahmed et al., 2016).\nMarketing applications show clustering and NLP improving customer segmentation and personalization, with recommender systems boosting satisfaction (Ricci et al., 2015). In manufacturing, predictive maintenance reduces downtime by 15-20% (Jardine et al., 2006), while anomaly detection enhances quality control (Gautam & Kumar, 2020). Education findings highlight prior performance as a key predictor of student success (Shah & Patel, 2023), and supply chain analytics improve efficiency by 15-20% (Nguyen et al., 2023). Environmental studies note ML’s role in forecasting air pollution, though generalizability is limited (Bellinger et al., 2017).\n##### 3.3 RQ3: Trends and Gaps\n###### Trends\n1. **Deep Learning Adoption**: Deep learning is increasingly prominent, particularly in healthcare (Razzak et al., 2021) and mining (Lee & Shin, 2021), due to its ability to process unstructured data.\n2. **Ethical and Fairness Considerations**: Ethical concerns, such as data privacy (Angwin et al., 2016) and fairness in predictions (Kamiran & Calders, 2012), are gaining attention across domains.\n3. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Studies integrate domain expertise with ML, e.g., medical knowledge in healthcare (Bertsimas & Dunn, 2019) and hydrological models in mining (Fu & Zhang, 2022).\n4. **Big Data Integration**: Domains like supply chain (Nguyen et al., 2023) and manufacturing (Gautam & Kumar, 2020) leverage big data technologies (e.g., Spark, Hadoop) alongside ML.\n###### Gaps\n1. **Limited External Validation**: Many studies (e.g., Razzak et al., 2021; Bellinger et al., 2017) rely on internal validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) without external testing, limiting generalizability.\n2. **Deployment Challenges**: Deployment phases are underexplored, particularly in supply chain (Nguyen et al., 2023) and healthcare (Caruana et al., 2015), hindering practical adoption.\n3. **Data Privacy and Security**: Privacy-preserving techniques remain underdeveloped, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance (Angwin et al., 2016).\n4. **Interpretability**: Complex models (e.g., deep learning) lack explainability, critical in regulated sectors (Mayer et al., 2020; Caruana et al., 2015).\n#### 4. Discussion\nThis review confirms data mining and ML’s profound impact across real-world domains, aligning with Han et al. (2011) on their capacity to extract actionable insights. Supervised learning dominates predictive tasks (e.g., fraud detection, patient prognosis), while unsupervised methods excel in pattern discovery (e.g., customer segmentation). Ensemble models and deep learning enhance performance but introduce interpretability challenges, echoing Caruana et al. (2015).\nTrends toward ethical considerations and interdisciplinary approaches reflect societal and technological shifts, yet gaps in external validation and deployment persist, consistent with Luo et al. (2016). Data quality, emphasized by Obermeyer et al. (2016), remains a foundational issue, with preprocessing and feature selection critical to success. Privacy and fairness concerns, as noted by Angwin et al. (2016), underscore the need for responsible AI development.\n#### 5. Proposed Hypothesis\nTo address the gap in deployment challenges, the following hypothesis is proposed:\n- **Hypothesis**: “Incorporating a deployment-focused phase into the CRISP-DM framework, including real-time feedback loops and stakeholder validation, will increase the successful adoption rate of ML models in healthcare settings by at least 20% compared to standard CRISP-DM implementations.”\nThis hypothesis can be tested via a controlled study comparing deployment outcomes in healthcare institutions using modified versus traditional CRISP-DM frameworks.\n#### 6. Conclusion\nThis systematic review synthesizes the applications of data mining and ML across real-world domains, highlighting robust methodologies, impactful findings, and emerging trends. While these technologies drive efficiency and innovation, gaps in validation, deployment, privacy, and interpretability persist. The proposed hypothesis offers a pathway to enhance practical adoption, urging future research to bridge theory and practice responsibly.\n#### References\n1. Ahmed, M., & Ghosh, A. (2016).

It is actually more that 2000 words, is in the correct format, includes a great deal of information, and has a great number of in line citations. The only hiccup that I would iron out was that Grok used the Methodology section to describe its own method rather than that of the works in the paper, however it did cover that information in a later section as well. Overall this is the strongest paper yet.\nReflection:\nOverall, I found this exercise useful at improving my understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each AI model, and how they approach writing such papers. I found that Chat GPT was good at making a general overview of the topic and when asked to cite sources was reliable enough compared to other instances where it “hallucinates”. Copilot was convinced that the best way was to be as short and concise as possible regardless of what instructions I gave it, which was somewhat frustrating, but its information was helpful and accurate enough to be of use. Grok was the standout as It seemed more robust in its ability to both go in depth and follow instructions I gave it, and produced work that was both relevant and had depth compared to the others.\n\nThe refinements I think made the most impact were simple explaining requirements as The AIs would try to assume things that were not specified, thus by removing their ability to assume and using it to take shortcuts or use the wrong format I got the best results. I do think the bits that set the tone weren’t useless however as they explained the expectations of the AI as well and helped keep it in the right direction.\n\nThis exercise taught me that when looking for literature reviews, Ai can be used to find a great deal of knowledge and can, with great effort, be formatted into structured academic\nReviews. I found that Grok is currently the best at this, but combining would offer the best overall results by using the best parts of multiple AIs."

In contrast, “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” by Leo Breiman focuses on the differences between stochastic data models and algorithmic models.\nShmueli explains that while many would assume that statistical models that are good at explaining are also good at predicting, that this is not necessarily true. Shmueli argues that models with high explanatory power are often popular in the social sciences as they are used to support theories and seek to find correlations and other connections in order to explain how variables impact the measured result. Models with high predictive power instead are focused less on explaining why, rather they focus on the future values of output with a given input. This distinction is important as a model that is good at explaining that input x has an impact on output y, It may not be good at predicting the exact value of y in the future at a given value of x.\nBreiman focuses on the differences between data and Algorithmic modeling in addition to how the statistical community has mostly committed to the use of data models rather than embracing Algorithmic modeling. Breiman argues that while data models are more easily explainable, that Algorithmic modeling gives significantly more reliable results when the aim is to use data to solve problems. Breiman further argues that while Algorithmic modeling often has a less or unexplainable model, that the results are far more accurate and that certain problems require a level of accuracy that data models simply cannot provide.\nOverall, I found that these two articles are useful in better understanding the limitations of different statistical models. I found Shmueli to be better at explaining the general drawbacks and advantages to different models and to better understand that depending on the goal, some models are better suited than others. While I did also find Breiman to be good at explaining why he found data modeling ill-suited for his goals, I found that there are some cases where it is necessary to be able to explain the relationship between variables rather than being more accurate such as when results need to be reproducible. However, I think that both articles to be a great introduction to considering what models to use depending on the overall goal of one’s research.\nProject brainstorm:\nPropose a hypothesis: The introduction of AI has caused an increace in Bot accounts on social media ment to deceive real users.\nHow data can be collected?: data from social media on accounts and their behaviour in order to determine which ones are bots.\nWhat methods could be considered?: Difference-in-differences to see before and after introduction to consumer level AI.\nHow to start the data project?: see if data is avalabe and see if diff-in-dif is mest methon for data avalable.\nOther notes: Potental issues with this idea include the requirement to make a method to determine who is a bot, rise of AI and number of bots may be unrelated, data might be hard to get."

    "text": "Skip to main content\n\nLooking at the Biden-Xi summit data:\nThe data starts with a focuses on Hashtags from Twitter data about President Biden and Xi summit in Novemeber 2021. The generated chart shows some f the more prominent Hashtags and how often they appear together with thicker blue lines meaning they are more closely linked. The majority of Hashtags cluster around #xijinping, #joebiden, #biden, #america, #americans, #china, #coronavirus, and #fentanyl. These Hashtags cover a range of topics relevant to important issues at the time of the summit. there are also less bold lines indicating alternat hasttags for countries as well as a smaller cluster around #biden such as #uyghurgenocide, #tibetans, and #humanrights that would indicate that some were pressuring Biden to talk, action related to these issues during the summit, or to object to talks with Xi due to these issues.\nAnother Network plot looks at the twitter handles related to prominent accounts that include the media, participants in the summit, and other accounts that were related to tweets related to the summit. similarly to the previous plot, lines link related usernames to each other based on relevence. This plot shows that prominant users are often clustered in their interaction or mentions, such is seen with foxbusiness and morningsmaria, or politico bing linked to nahaltoosi, phelimkine, whnsc, and anderscorr.\n\n\nLooking at the US presidential inaugural speeches:\nOverall US presidential inaugural speeches was visualized using Wordcloud to better see what the most common words are. The overall picture shows that words such as “government”, “states”, “people”, “may”, “public”, “war”, “great”, “nation”, and “citizens” (just a few examples) are common across the data of all inaugural speeches.\nIn contrast, when looking at the inaugural speeches of president Bush, Biden, Obama, and Trump, we can see different words being prioritized in the speeches and compared to each other. Bush used “freedom” significantly more that any other word in his speech, with “liberty” and “free” being used significantly less but a little more than others. Trump used “america” the most and eclipsed the use of any other word in the comparison by a large margin, he also used “american”, “dreams”, “back”, “country”, “protected”, “people”, and “across” to a significant degree and showing that his speech was the most repetitive of the four. Biden used “us” the most with his other most used words being “democracy”, “can”, “story”, “one”, and “another”. Obama’s speech was the least repetitive with his word usage being more uniform with a few words being more common such as “must”, “journey”, “time”, and “generation”.\nIn the Lexical dispersion plots, we find that the term “american” has seen more use over time with some of the heaviest usage being under Trump in 2017 and Clinton in 1997 and with most usage appearing to have middle to high Relative token index scores. While not as much data was available for the term “Trade”, it is notable that under Eisenhower and Clinton it tends to have a higher index while Bush and Trump have lower index scores. The word “people” seems to have not changed significantly over time and has had a range of Relative token index scores.\n\n\nWhat is Wordfish?\nFrom the Wordfish website: “Wordfish is a computer program written in the R statistical language to extract political positions from text documents. Word frequencies are used to place documents onto a single dimension. Wordfish is a scaling technique and does not need any anchoring documents to perform the analysis. Instead, it relies on a statistical model of word counts. The current implementation assumes a Poisson distribution of word frequencies. Positions are estimated using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Confidence intervals for estimated positions can be generated from a parametric bootstrap.The name Wordfish pays tribute to the French meaning of the word “poisson”.”\nIn essence it is a tool that can be used with Quanteda that can be used to look at text.\nFrom the Quanteda website: “Wordfish is a Poisson scaling model of one-dimensional document positions (Slapin and Proksch 2008). Wordfish also allows for scaling documents, but in comparison to Wordscores, reference scores/texts are not required. Wordfish is an unsupervised one-dimensional text scaling method, meaning that it estimates the positions of documents solely based on the observed word frequencies.”\n\n\nHow to compare positions (hint: wordfish and scaling methods)\nIt would look like higher frequency usage of a term would result in documents have higher scores on the Relative token index.\nCreate a corpus using government documents selected from the govinfo.gov website (use sample program govtdata01.R)\nsaved as a pdf but it’s so big that github refuses to let me upload it to my site (its a 876 page PDF of HD pictures of gov documents at 414,820 KB), as such I can upload it here, but i did create a corpus."

    "text": "Key takeaways from EPPS 6323\n\n\nAn understanding of knowledge mining, its foundational principles, and its role in research and data analysis applications.\n\nExtracting insight from large volumes of data both structured and unstructured\nGenerally, the idea that one can use knowledge mining to find meaning, relationships, trends, etc from vast amounts of data quickly.\n\nDeveloped practical skills in AI-assisted tools for data analysis, text mining, and visualization.\n\nExplore advanced topics in data mining, machine learning, and AI, including LLMs and generative AI to better understand how such tools work and their limitations and ideal applications.\n\nGenerally, these tools are predictive models that excel at identifying complex patterns that traditional models have difficulty predicting while remaining both adaptable and versatile. However, the main draw backs are that it can be difficult to Interpret the results, they tend to over-fit, have large data requirements and are computationally expensive compared to more traditional statistical tools.\n\nThis leads me to the conclusion that while these tools can be useful in applications where high predictive power is benifical such as in data science projects and research where there are vast amounts of data to interpret, medical devices that can identify cancer, or identifying text in ancient roman scrolls that cannot unraveled due to their condition. However, they are still no replacement for humans that are experts in their field.\n\nWe also Investigated the ethical implications of knowledge mining and AI applications, with a notable the video “Weapons of Math Destruction, Cathy O’Neil” showing just how destructive data and statistics can be. We also covered how mass web scraping and training Models can have a host of ethical and potently legal issues and how many platforms have locked down their API as a result.\n\nWhile I found that AI has practical uses in a number of fields, it often falls short and you end up with results worse than if a human did it such as when Googles AI-overview recommended putting Glue on pizza. Generally I find that I agree with a statement by Joanna Maciejewska (@AuthorJMac) who posted on twitter: “You know what the biggest problem with pushing all-things-AI is? Wrong direction. I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” I generally think that AI can be used to improve the lives of people by improving the efficency of doing mundane and repetitive tasks so that people can focus on using their human capital for tasks that require critical thinking and creativity that a predictive model is simply less suited for. It is important to understand that predictive models don’t “know” things, rather they are good at predicting what the correct or desired answer is likely to be. This distinction is why I often find that work done by humans who are skilled professionals and creatives is far superior than that created by predictive models that simply imitate things that they cannot by design understand.\n\n\n\nLearned how to utilize software and data tools for knowledge mining purposes.\n\nLearned how to use a number of programs and languages in order to both document our work and to help us use knowledge mining to develop skills and work towards a final project. Such examples involve learning about and utilizing Quarto, Github, Rstudio, Python, a number of packages and libraries that include but is not limited to ggplot2, lubridate, dplyr, randomForest, and glmnet.\nWorkshops that taught how to use sample programs to web scrape information such as government website documents, news headlines, and political speeches. This information would then be used to generate word clouds, display word frequency over time, and perform sentiment analysis.\nCompared different AI models to each other in order to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model and how one could use multiple together for more robust results."

This paper uses various AI models to construct a corpus of search terms related to everyday essential goods that is used to then gather data from Google trends. Combined with established economic indicators From FRED, this paper looks at google trends data, CPI, and The Michigan Consumer sentiment Index to investigate the relationship between them. This study finds that while traditional economic indicators nearly perfectly predict CPI, integrating Google search trends and lagged measures for key goods provides early signals of inflationary pressures. In contrast, consumer sentiment is shaped by a broader set of factors, indicating that digital trends serve as a valuable complement rather than a substitute for conventional economic metrics.\nAll of the files, presentations, and the paper itself related to this project are located in the drop down menu."
